## What is this?

This project focuses on the comprehensive implementation of a 5G core, encompassing crucial components such as Radio Access Networks (RANs), User Equipment (UEs), Data Networks (DNs), and dynamic Network Slicing. The primary objective is to develop a fully functional 5G environment comprising multiple User Equipmentâ€™s (UEs), Next Generation Base Stations (gNBs), Network Functions (NFs), and diverse network slices. Through this endeavor, the aim is to create an elaborate simulation platform that accurately mirrors the complexities and functionalities of real-world 5G networks, facilitating in-depth analysis and experimentation within a virtualized environment.

## Getting Started

Before continuing to set up the Open5GS 5G Core Simulation Mobile Network, it's essential to check your machine's parameters to ensure smooth operation.

### Requirements

Our machine parameters were as follows:

- **RAM**: 16 GB DDR4
- **Processor**: Intel i5-10600KF
  - **Total Cores**: 6
  - **Total Threads**: 12
  - **Max Turbo Frequency**: 4.80 GHz
- **Storage**: 1 TB SSD

Please note that running all five VMs with Ubuntu 22.04 installed on each may utilize the full capacity of your machine, potentially leading to system crashes. It's crucial to monitor system resources closely during operation.


### Install

To set up the necessary components for this project, please follow the instructions provided below:

- **Open5GS v2.7.0 (2024-02-12)**: Refer to the [Open5GS Quickstart Guide](https://open5gs.org/open5gs/docs/guide/01-quickstart/) for detailed instructions on setting up Open5GS.

- **UERANSIM v3.2.6**: Follow the installation guidelines outlined in the [UERANSIM Installation Guide](https://github.com/aligungr/UERANSIM/wiki/Installation).

Install MongoDB on the Open5GS 5GC C-Plane machine; MongoDB installation is not required on Open5GS 5GC U-Plane machines.


## Overview of Open5GS 5G Core Simulation Mobile Network Setup

To begin setting up the Open5GS 5G Core Simulation Mobile Network, ensure that VirtualBox is installed on your system. Once installed, create six Virtual Machines (VMs). Each VM should have Ubuntu 22.04 installed.

Below is a table detailing the parameters and IP addresses of each VM:

## Modifications to Configuration Files of Open5GS 5GC and UERANSIM User Equipment (UE) / Radio Access Network (RAN)

### Useful Commands
Here are some useful commands that can assist you in managing and operating your project:
To modify a YAML file in read-only mode, utilize the command:
```bash
sudo vi amf.yaml
```
YAML files are sensitive to indentation. To edit, press the delete button to remove the existing IP address, then press the insert button to insert your IP. After making necessary changes, save and exit by pressing :wq followed by the Enter key.
To validate a YAML file for errors, execute:
```bash
sudo yamllint amf.yaml
```
After each configuration, restart the corresponding service. For instance, to restart the AMF service, run:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart open5gs-amfd.service
```
To verify the status of a service, execute:
```bash
sudo systemctl status open5gs-amfd
```

Post configuration, ensure that all services are running by executing:
```bash
ps aux | grep open5gs
```

### Adjustments to Configuration Files of Open5GS 5GC Control Plane

## Network settings of Open5GS 5GC and UERANSIM UE / RAN
### Network settings of Open5GS U-Plane 1
It is necessary to uncomment the next line in the  **/etc/sysctl.conf** file and show it in the OS.
```bash
net.ipv4.ip_forward1
#sysctl -p
```
The following commands are essential every time when initiating U-Plane 1. After that, configure the TUNnel interface and NAPT.
```bash
sudo ip tuntap add name ogstun mode tun
sudo ip addr add 10.45.0.1/16 dev ogstun
sudo ip link set ogstun up

sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.45.0.0/16 ! -o ogstun -j MASQUERADE

sudo ip tuntap add name ogstun2 mode tun
sudo ip addr add 10.46.0.1/16 dev ogstun2
sudo ip link set ogstun2 up

sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.46.0.0/16 ! -o ogstun2 -j MASQUERADE
```
### Network settings of Open5GS U-Plane 2
Like above, first, uncomment the next line in the **/etc/sysctl.conf** file and represent it in the OS.
```bash
net.ipv4.ip_forward1
#sysctl -p
```
The following commands are essential every time when initiating U-Plane 2. Next, the configuration of the TUNnel interface and NAPT is required. Follow the commands below for necessary adjusments.
```bash
sudo ip tuntap add name ogstun3 mode tun

## Test Ping google.com
To verify that everything is functioning properly, a comprehensive test will be conducted. In VM5 we use the command below to ping google.com.
```bash
ping -I uesimtun0 google.com
```
The information provided from the ping google.com command is as follows.
```bash

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the project has successfully achieved its objective of establishing a comprehensive and functional virtualized 5G core simulation environment utilizing Open5GS and UERANSIM. This environment closely resembles real-world 5G networks, enabling in-depth analysis, experimentation, and testing of various scenarios and configurations. The process of configuring multiple virtual machines with Ubuntu 22.04 and installing Open5GS and UERANSIM was precisly executed, ensuring the continuous operation of the simulation environment. The project's success was evident in the successful simulation of both the 5G core and user equipment. By adjusting network settings, running essential services, and executing necessary commands, the simulation environment was set up to simulate the functionalities and interactions of a 5G network. This involved the establishment of the 5G core network, registration of user equipment, and the initiation of data sessions, among other essential operations. The establishment of this simulation environment is a significant milestone in the field of 5G networking. It provides a valuable platform for researchers, developers, and network engineers to conduct experiments, evaluate new technologies, and develop innovative solutions in a controlled and efficient manner. The detailed documentation and step-by-step guide provided in this project also serve as a valuable resource for those looking to replicate or extend this work.
